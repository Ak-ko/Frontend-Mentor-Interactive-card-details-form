Hi, this is my first experience in here but I have been coding a while. My name is Aung Khant and I am from Myanmar and I worked as a freelance website developer but need to try better. In this project, I was busied with position the images which are credit-cards indeed but  some other stuffs are easy.

Documentation
--------------

 I have used only
----------------------------
* HTML, CSS and Vanilla-Js,
* google font api ( for the font needed which is 'Space Grotesk' ),
* Cleave.js

I know a little bit about react but it's a bit challenge to me in doing this project with react.  Then, I chose using only three basic things in web-dev.

Cleave.js is used for formatting the credit-card format. It allows you to format almost every type of the credit-card. It is super cool and easy to use too.

Reference for Cleave.js
----------------------------------------

Check out there and you will have fun.

This website is super-cool and easy to use. It's purpose is to check your credit card whether it is valid or invalid.
You can check your card by adding information in the required fields and then click the button provided below. And that's it.

Hopefully, it will work more with backends which can do realtime managements.

Anyway, thank you for reading this text and checkout my website.



Wish you all the best and see you guys.
